This automated ordering device can be used by restaurants, or any retail businesses to calculate orders more effectively. It uses a gradient boosting machine learning model to dynamically train itself on previous sales and usage data, and keeps training itself based on stock take data fed into the program.
It's effective at forecasting future usage, since the ML model will be trained with a variety of variables and will pick up on many trends and patterns within the data.

This is my first ever fully fledged project, and im excited to improve it further.

Features:
- Built in stocktake
- Order calculation page
- Settings page to tailor the program to business needs

Project Plans:
- Will be moved to a web based program using JavaScript and Django (away from tkinter 🤮). This will improve compatibility, usability, performance and security.
- Improvements to the ML model
